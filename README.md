# Gesture-Volume-Control

This program uses the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to capture hand gestures from a webcam and adjust the system volume accordingly.

### Features:
1. Hand Detection: The script uses the Mediapipe hand detection model to detect the presence of a hand in the video feed.
2. Thumb and Index Finger Tracking: The script identifies the tips of the thumb and index finger and tracks their movement.
3. Volume Adjustment: The distance between the thumb and index finger is used to control the system volume. As the distance between the fingers increases, the volume increases, and vice versa.
4. Persistent Volume Setting: If the user maintains the "thumb and index finger" position for 10 seconds, the volume level is locked in and displayed.
5. Real-time Visualization: The script displays the video feed with the detected hand landmarks and the current volume level.

### Requirements:
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe
NumPy
pycaw

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw
```

### Explanation:
1. The script initializes the camera, Mediapipe hands detection, and the system audio interface.
2. The main loop reads the video frames, processes them for hand detection, and extracts the landmark coordinates of the thumb and index finger.
3. The Euclidean distance between the thumb and index finger tips is calculated and mapped to the system volume range.
4. The volume is adjusted accordingly using the pycaw library.
5. If the user maintains the "thumb and index finger" position for 10 seconds, the final volume level is displayed.
6. The video feed with the detected hand landmarks and volume level is displayed in a window.
7. The application can be exited by pressing the 'x' key.
